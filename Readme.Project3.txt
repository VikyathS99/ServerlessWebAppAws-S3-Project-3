I'M EXCITED TO SHARE MY SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ANOTHER PROJECT: SERVERLESS WEB APPLICATION ON AWS using S3 instead of Amplify.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
In this project, I built a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table through a RESTful API.

STEPS TO BUILD THE PROJECT:

Create a DynamoDB Table: Set up a DynamoDB table to store the items.
Build a Lambda Function: Develop a Lambda function to handle CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.
Create an API Gateway RESTful API: Establish an API Gateway RESTful API to interact with the Lambda function.
Use S3 for Static Files: Utilize S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
Create a CloudFront Distribution: Implement a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency.
EXPECTED OUTCOME:
Upon completing the project, I achieved a working serverless web application hosted on AWS. This project provided hands-on experience in building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, and Cognito. Additionally, it enhanced my skills in working with various AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.

This project significantly improved my skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
